    "Due to the high computational cost associated with running the model, an exhaustive hyperparameter search is nearly impossible. Playing around a few times, I settled for a `sequence_lengths` of 120, an emdding dimension of 100, a   `hidden_dim` of 500 and `n_layers` of 2. These parameters made the computation a little faster, yet not compromising the high dimensional nature of the problem we are modeling. I initially trained the model on lower hyperparameters and one layer and achieved a training loss of less 3.5 on 10 epochs. The model exhibit oscillations at about 3.5 training loss, I suspect there is a local minimum in the objective manifold at that training instance.  \n",
    "My understanding is that a higer hidden dimension will lead to better performance since this a $21388$-class clssification problem. Though the problem is very high dimensional, the semantics of the text revolves around a low dimensional story, and this is my motivation for a two-layer lstm and the high dimensionality reduction in the embedding and lstm layers."
